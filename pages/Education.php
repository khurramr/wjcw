       <li>The <strong>first word revealed</strong> to our <strong>Prophet</strong> Muhammad (Peace Be upon Him) from Allah SWT was "Iqra" which means <strong>To Read! To seek knowledge</strong>.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Islam</strong> placed a high value on <strong>education</strong>, and, as the faith spread among diverse peoples,&nbsp;<strong>education</strong> became an <strong>important</strong> channel through which to create a universal and cohesive social order. After the 11th century, however, denominational interests dominated higher learning, and the <strong>Islamic</strong> sciences achieved preeminence.
    </li>
    <li>
    The Quran stresses the importance of reading, studying, reflecting and investigating, and this is a commandment prescribed to all Muslims.
        To seek knowledge is a sacred duty; it is obligatory on every Muslim, male and female. “IQRA BIISMI RABBIKA ALLAZI KHALQ”. Read! In the name of your Lord who created (all the exists). Surah Al’Alaq <strong>96:1</strong>    
    </li>
   <li>In its most literal sense, <strong>Islamic education</strong> can refer to efforts by the Muslim community to educate its own, to pass along the heritage of <strong>Islamic</strong> knowledge, first and foremost through its primary sources, the Quraan and Ahlul-Bayt.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Some</strong> advantages of <strong>education</strong> are: it boosts economic growth and increases the GDP of a <strong>country</strong>. It even reduces infant mortality rate, increases human life expectancy. <strong>Education</strong> is an <strong>important</strong> investment in a <strong>country</strong> as there are huge benefits. WJCW will aim to achieve free education around the globe.
