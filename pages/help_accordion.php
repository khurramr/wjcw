                <p>WJCW CF is a straightforward way to gather funds.</p>
                <p>There are 3 very easy steps:</p>
                <p><strong>Step 1</strong> &#8211; First register yourself and send a gift/donation to become an active member. To join, you need to firstly input the membership/referee key of the person who invited you, fill out your information and click “JOIN”. You will need to pay the licence fee of £12 (for 2020/21) and also select the gift/donation level of your choice (£20, £40, £100, £250, £500, £1000, etc).</p>
                <p><strong>Step 2</strong> &#8211; Share the WJCW CF platform with two people, or as many as you can, and help them become active members.</p>
                <p><strong>Step 3</strong> &#8211; At every level, half of the funds of a gift /donation go to the person who invited you and the other half of funds go to another person who is already in the WJCW CF system. When you receive a gift/donation, then you keep 50% for yourself and you must send 50% to WJCW CF. Then you open the next level.</p>

In order to benefit more, you must invite two people to join WJCW CF who will then gift/donate half of their gift/donations to you, and so on and so forth.</p>
